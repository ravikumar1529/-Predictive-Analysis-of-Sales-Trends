Creating a predictive analysis project for sales trends through data science involves several steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, model training, and evaluation. Below, I'll provide a high-level outline of the project and some sample code snippets in Python to help you get started. Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and real-world projects may require more extensive work.

1. Data Collection:

Gather historical sales data, including features like date, product, price, and sales volume. You can use libraries like pandas to load and manipulate the data.
